                      :(pronunciation: coo-kyou)
at some (?) point during the past Kukyou started poinsoning Naio against Maki. They were communicating (somehow?) and eventualy during one of Maki and Kukyou's many
battles, (this time at sea of swords) the betrayal happens. while Maki is fighting Kukyou, She is suddenly stabbed (littelary in the back) by Naiou then in the front by Kukyou and tossed overboard.
(how she survided is unknown)
those loyal to maki fight a losing battle and are slaughtered as a result. turn coats are spared and Kukyou now captains The Obsidian Cruciple

vice captain Naiou's whereabouts or what was exchanged for the betrayal are unknown (so that you may or may not use him if you so desire)
